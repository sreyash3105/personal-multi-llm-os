Objective

This roadmap defines future development phases, focusing on automation, reliability, and scalability — without breaking the core experience of:

Local-first

Offline-capable

Modular

Developer-oriented

🚀 Version Timeline
Version	State	Theme
V2 (current)	Finished	Personal AI OS with Code + Study + Vision + Multi-Profile Chat
V3 (next)	In development	Automations / Tools / API Integrations / RAG
V4 (future)	Planned	Autonomous Workflows & Multi-Agent System
📦 V2 → V3 Upgrade Goals
💡 V3 focuses on connecting AI to the real world
Category	Goal
📦 Automations	Assistant can execute tools & APIs
🔍 RAG	Private documents → indexed → retrieved context → chat
🧾 File memory	Upload PDFs, DOCX, folders and store them in profile
🔌 Cloud APIs	Travel / Emails / Jira / Notion / DB / Stripe etc
▶️ Actions	“Book flight”, “generate proposal”, “update website”
⏳ Schedulers	Automated periodic tasks (cron-like)
Mandatory base additions

/api/tools/* endpoint namespace

tools/ directory for pluggable automations

RAG storage: profiles/<id>/kb/ + embeddings store

Permissions system: allow / deny tool execution

♟ V3 Internal System Design

A Tool-call architecture

User prompt → LLM → detects required tool → tool executes → returns result → LLM continues


LLM response format example:

{
  "tool": "flight_search",
  "args": { "from": "DEL", "to": "DXB", "date": "2025-01-22" }
}


Then pipeline executes tool → returns → adds result back to chat.

📌 V3 Feature List Breakdown
1. 🔧 Tools System
Priority	Tool
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐	Python eval sandbox (code execution)
⭐⭐⭐⭐	HTTP caller
⭐⭐⭐	File memory loader
⭐⭐⭐	Search (Bing / Google / DuckDuckGo)
⭐⭐	Email reader/sender
⭐	Shell command runner
2. 📚 Private Knowledge Base (RAG)

Drop folder / upload zip → auto-index

Chat aware of profile-specific docs

Chunk embeddings per profile

No cloud, purely local

3. 🌍 API Packs (optional installs)
Pack	APIs
Travel Pack	Skyscanner / Booking / TripAdvisor / Airbnb
Business Pack	Notion / Trello / Jira / Gmail / Slack
E-commerce Pack	Stripe / Razorpay / Shopify
4. 🧠 Planning + Execution Flow

Pipeline evolves from:

Prompt → Code/Study/Vision/Chat


into:

Prompt → Planner → (RAG?) → Tool executor → LLM summarizer → Final reply

🔥 V4 (Long-term Vision)
🎛 Full Autonomous Personal Workspace
Feature	Description
Multi-agents	Designer, Researcher, Developer, Tester, Marketer
Shared memory	Persistent improvement across projects
Self-upgrading	System rewrites own tools as needed
Full workflow execution	Idea → Docs → Code → Test → Deploy
Project brain	Automatic project documentation + reports
🧩 Extensions Strategy
Target	Max Safety	Max Power
Developer tools	Direct execution allowed	
Business APIs	Token vault required	
Finance APIs	2FA + approval	
OS shell	Disabled until manually enabled	
🚫 What we will never sacrifice
Rule	Reason
Local-first by default	Privacy + speed
User control	No hidden automation
No silent internet calls	Transparency
No training on private data	Safety
🪜 Release Plan Estimation
Phase	Time	Result
V3-alpha	4–6 weeks	RAG + Tool execution
V3-beta	8 weeks	API Packs + Scheduling
V3-stable	12 weeks	Seamless business automations
V4-alpha	When ready	Multi-Agent system
🔥 Quick Summary
V2 = High-power personal assistant
V3 = AI that can take actions + use tools + read documents
V4 = AI that can run full workflows and manage projects end-to-end
