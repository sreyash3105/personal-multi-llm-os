## Current Focus
- Setting up vibe coding infrastructure
- Stabilizing architecture and workflow
- Establishing validation-first development

---

## Active Constraints
- Single model at a time (8 GB VRAM)
- Local-first execution
- No premature UI work
- No autonomous behavior

---

## Do NOT Do
- Do not refactor architecture casually
- Do not simplify math for convenience
- Do not bypass validation steps

---

## Open Questions
- [Add questions here as they arise]

---

## Notes for AI Models
- Re-read this file before acting
- If unsure, ask before modifying code
